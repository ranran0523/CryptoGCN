            /*
            We start by briefly discussing the Serializable<T> generic class. This is
            a wrapper class that can wrap any serializable class, which include:

                - EncryptionParameters
                - Modulus
                - Plaintext and Ciphertext
                - SecretKey, PublicKey, RelinKeys, and GaloisKeys

            Serializable<T> provides minimal functionality needed to serialize the wrapped
            object by simply forwarding the calls to corresponding functions of the wrapped
            object of type T. The need for Serializable<T> comes from the fact that many
            Microsoft SEAL objects consist of two parts, one of which is pseudorandom data
            independent of the other part. Until the object is actually being used, the
            pseudorandom part can be instead stored as a seed. We will call objects with
            property `seedable'.

            For example, GaloisKeys can often be very large in size, but in reality half
            of the data is pseudorandom and can be stored as a seed. Since GaloisKeys are
            never used by the party that generates them, so it makes sense to expand the
            seed at the point deserialization. On the other hand, we cannot allow the user
            to accidentally try to use an unexpanded GaloisKeys object, which is prevented
            at by ensuring it is always wrapped in a Serializable<GaloisKeys> and can only
            be serialized.

            Only some Microsoft SEAL objects are seedable. Specifically, they are:

                - PublicKey, RelinKeys, and GaloisKeys
                - Ciphertext in secret-key mode (from Encryptor.EncryptSymmetric or
                  Encryptor.EncryptZeroSymmetric)

            Importantly, ciphertexts in public-key mode are not seedable. Thus, it may
            be beneficial to use Microsoft SEAL in secret-key mode whenever the public
            key is not truly needed.

            There are a handful of functions that output Serializable<T> objects:

                - Encryptor.Encrypt (and variants) output Serializable<Ciphertext>
                - KeyGenerator.Create... output Serializable<T> for different key types

            Note that Encryptor.Encrypt is included in the above list, yet it produces
            ciphertexts in public-key mode that are not seedable. This is for the sake of
            consistency in the API for public-key and secret-key encryption. Functions
            that output Serializable<T> objects also have overloads that take a normal
            object of type T as a destination parameter, overwriting it. These overloads
            can be convenient for local testing where no serialization is needed and the
            object needs to be used at the point of construction. Such an object can no
            longer be transformed back to a seeded state.

            To simulate client-server interaction, we set up a shared C# stream. In real

            It is critical to note that all data serialized by Microsoft SEAL is in binary
            form, so it is not meaningful to print the data as ASCII characters. Encodings
            such as Base64 would increase the data size, which is already a bottleneck in
            homomorphic encryption. Hence, serialization into text is not supported or
            recommended.

                Before moving on, we will take some time to discuss further options in
                serialization. These will become particularly important when the user
                needs to optimize communication and storage sizes.

                It is possible to enable or disable compression for serialization by
                providing EncryptionParameters.Save with the desired compression mode as
                in the following examples:

                    long size = parms.Save(sharedStream, ComprModeType.None);
                    long size = parms.Save(sharedStream, ComprModeType.ZLIB);
                    long size = parms.Save(sharedStream, ComprModeType.ZSTD);

                If Microsoft SEAL is compiled with Zstandard or ZLIB support, the default
                is to use one of them. If available, Zstandard is preferred over ZLIB due
                to its speed.

                Compression can have a substantial impact on the serialized data size,
                because ciphertext and key data consists of many uniformly random integers
                modulo the CoeffModulus primes. Especially when using CKKS, the primes in
                CoeffModulus can be relatively small compared to the 64-bit words used to
                store the ciphertext and key data internally. Serialization writes full
                64-bit words to the destination buffer or stream, possibly leaving in many
                zero bytes corresponding to the high-order bytes of the 64-bit words. One
                convenient way to get rid of these zeros is to apply a general-purpose
                compression algorithm on the encrypted data. The compression rate can be
                significant (up to 50-60%) when using CKKS with small primes.
                */

                /*
                In many cases, when working with fixed size memory, it is necessary to know
                ahead of time an upper bound on the serialized data size to allocate enough
                memory. This information is returned by the EncryptionParameters.SaveSize
                function. This function accepts the desired compression mode, or uses the
                default option otherwise.

                In more detail, the output of EncryptionParameters.SaveSize is as follows:

                    - Exact buffer size required for ComprModeType.None;
                    - Upper bound on the size required for ComprModeType.ZLIB or
                      ComprModeType.ZSTD.

                As we can see from the print-out, the sizes returned by these functions
                are significantly larger than the compressed size written into the shared
                stream in the beginning. This is normal: compression yielded a significant
                improvement in the data size, however, it is impossible to know ahead of
                time the exact size of the compressed data. If compression is not used,
                then the size is exactly determined by the encryption parameters.

            Finally, we give a little bit more explanation of the structure of data
            serialized by Microsoft SEAL. Serialized data always starts with a 16-byte
            SEALHeader struct, as defined in dotnet/src/Serialization.cs, and is
            followed by the possibly compressed data for the object.

            A SEALHeader contains the following data:

                [offset 0] 2-byte magic number 0xA15E (Serialization.SEALMagic)
                [offset 2] 1-byte indicating the header size in bytes (always 16)
                [offset 3] 1-byte indicating the Microsoft SEAL major version number
                [offset 4] 1-byte indicating the Microsoft SEAL minor version number
                [offset 5] 1-byte indicating the compression mode type
                [offset 6] 2-byte reserved field (unused)
                [offset 8] 8-byte size in bytes of the serialized data, including the header

            Currently Microsoft SEAL supports only little-endian systems.

            As an example, we demonstrate the SEALHeader created by saving a plaintext.
            Note that the SEALHeader is never compressed, so there is no need to specify
            the compression mode.
